\tableofcontents

SpECTRE has a command-line interface (CLI) that allows you to run executables,
work with output data, and generate plots and visualizations. To get started,
compile the `cli` target in your build directory. Then run:

```sh
./bin/spectre --help
```

All available commands are listed in the [Python documentation](py/cli.html).
