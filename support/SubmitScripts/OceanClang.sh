# To run a job on Ocean:
# - Set the -J, --nodes, and -t options above, which correspond to job name,
#   number of nodes, and wall time limit in HH:MM:SS, respectively.
# - Set the build directory, run directory, executable name,
#   and input file below.
# - Add a file ${HOME}/.charmrunrc that does the following (replace
#   ${SPECTRE_BUILD_DIR}/../ with the path to your spectre checkout):
#    source /etc/profile.d/lmod.sh
#    source ${SPECTRE_BUILD_DIR}/../support/Environments/ocean_clang.sh
#    spectre_load_modules
#
# NOTE: The executable will not be copied from the build directory, so if you
#       update your build directory this file will use the updated executable.
#
# Optionally, if you need more control over how SpECTRE is launched on
# Ocean you can edit the launch command at the end of this file directly.
#
# To submit the script to the queue run:
#   sbatch Ocean.sh

# Replace these paths with the path to your build directory, to the source root
# directory, the spectre dependencies module directory, and to the directory
# where you want the output to appear, i.e. the run directory.
# E.g., if you cloned spectre in your home directory, set
# SPECTRE_BUILD_DIR to ${HOME}/spectre/build. If you want to run in a
# directory called "Run" in the current directory, set
# SPECTRE_RUN_DIR to ${PWD}/Run
